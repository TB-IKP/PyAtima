	'''PyAtima class

	Arguments:
	----------
	Zp: int
		Proton number of projectile.
	Ap: int
		Mass number of projectile.
	E: float
		Energy of projectile [MeV/u].
	Zt: int
		Proton number of target.
	At: float
		Molar mass of target [u].
	t: float
		Target thickness [mg/cm2].

	Attributes:
	-----------
	results: dict
		Results of Atima run with keys.

	Note:
	-----
	PyAtima is a wrapper for Atima. The Atima source code
	can be found at https://web-docs.gsi.de/~weick/atima/
	PyAtima expects that Atima can be invoked from the 
	command line by calling atimawww.
	See the included documentation for more information.
